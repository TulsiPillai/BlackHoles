# BlackHoles
This is a game I'm developing to simulate a Binary black hole system. The scripts are used for calculating radiations of gravitational waves and its effect on a human model. 
List of scripts
1. StretchFactor - Physics calculations of GW effects
2. Transform Player - PLayer navigation controls
3. LookAtTarget - adjust object to face one point even after being transformed
